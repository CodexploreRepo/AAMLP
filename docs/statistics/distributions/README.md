# Distribution

## Discrete

- **Poisson (Count) Distribution**: how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period
  - Parameters: lambda (`Î»`) the mean number of events in the specific interval.
  - Usage: to understand independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.
  - Example: if the average number of people who buy cheeseburgers from a fast-food chain on a Friday night at a single restaurant location is 200, a Poisson distribution can answer questions such as, "What is the probability that more than 300 people will buy burgers?"

## Continuous Distributions

- **Exponential Distribution**: a continuous probability distribution that often concerns the amount of time until some specific event happens.
