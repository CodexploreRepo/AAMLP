# Quantile Quantile (Q-Q) plot

- The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot is a graphical method for determining if a dataset follows a certain probability distribution or whether two samples of data came from the same population or not.
  - Q-Q plots are particularly useful for assessing whether a dataset is normally distributed or if it follows some other known distribution.

```Python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats

# Generate example of normal distribution data
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=1000)

# Create Q-Q plot
stats.probplot(data, dist="norm", plot=plt)
plt.title('Normal Q-Q plot')
plt.xlabel('Theoretical quantiles')
plt.ylabel('Ordered Values')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

- The Q-Q plot is constructed by plotting the quantiles of our residuals on the y-axis against the quantiles of a theoretical distribution, in this case the normal distribution, on the x-axis.
  - If both distributions are similar, meaning that the distribution of the residuals is close to a normal distribution, the Q-Q plot will display a straight line that approximately lies on $y = x$.
  - If both distributions are not similar, meaning that the distribution of the residuals is not close to a normal distribution, the Q-Q plot will generate the curve that departs from $y = x$.
