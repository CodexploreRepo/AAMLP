    "### Challenges\n",
    "- Class Imbalance: very few transactions are fraudulent (less than 1%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "- The model produces a score in the 0-100 range for each charge\n",
    "- Threshold Selection: need to choose the threshold \n",
    "    - to maximize the Recall (i.e. can detect as much fraud cases)\n",
    "    - to minimize the False Positive Rate (not stopping so much good transactions)\n",
    "- Threshold: block the transaction if the score >=30 (i.e: fraud)\n",
